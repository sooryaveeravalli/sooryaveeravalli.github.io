Welcome! My name is Soorya Veeravalli. I'm a graduate student in Computer Science at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu), focusing on AI, NLP, and computer vision. I bring 3+ years of industry experience from my time as a Software Engineer 2 at [Microsoft (Azure)](https://azure.microsoft.com), where I worked on building and scaling cloud-based systems.

My research work includes contributions to computer vision during my undergraduate studies, resulting in a publication at WACV, and ongoing projects in natural language processing and computer vision at UMass.

Previously, I have:
- Worked in the Azure Cloud division at Microsoft on distributed and scalable services.
- Conducted research in computer vision during my undergrad, leading to a peer-reviewed paper ([WACV 2021](https://saisoorya2000.github.io/GlocalNet/)).

Currently, I am working at the UMASS BioNLP lab with [Prof. Hong Yu](https://www.cics.umass.edu/about/directory/hong-yu), focusing on research at the intersection of natural language processing and biomedical informatics.

**Research Interests:** 3D Vision, Decoding strategies for NLP, Model Interpretability, Generative AI, Reinforcement Learning

I'm passionate about bridging academic research and real-world applications, and I'm always open to collaborations on impactful AI projects.
