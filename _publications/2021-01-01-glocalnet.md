This paper addresses the challenging task of long-term human motion synthesis by proposing a two-stage activity generation method. The first stage learns long-term global pose dependencies by synthesizing sparse motion trajectories, while the second stage generates dense motion trajectories. Our method can synthesize long-term (> 6000 ms) human motion trajectories across a large variety of human activity classes (> 50), demonstrating superiority over state-of-the-art methods on publicly available datasets.

**Key Contributions:**
- Two-stage architecture for long-term motion synthesis
- Class-aware motion generation across 50+ activity types
- Effective handling of temporal dependencies and pose variations
- Superior performance on quantitative evaluation metrics

**Applications:** Augmented Reality, 3D character animations, pedestrian trajectory prediction, and human-centric video generation.
